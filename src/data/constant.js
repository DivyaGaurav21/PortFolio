      "Created a YouTube-like platform, which can display and play videos, search and browse video content, and manage user accounts. The project uses the React library as its frontend framework, which allows for building a responsive, dynamic user interface with reusable components. Material UI is used as the design system to provide a consistent look and feel throughout the application. This helps to create a modern and intuitive user experience. In addition, the YouTube API is integrated into the project, allowing users to search for videos and view their details such as title, description, and duration. Users can also play videos directly from the app and browse related content.",
